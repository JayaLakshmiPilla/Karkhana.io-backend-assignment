Möbius Strip Geometry – Karkhana.io Backend Assignment
This project models a Möbius strip using parametric equations in Python. It generates a 3D mesh, estimates surface area using numerical integration, computes edge length, and visualizes the strip using matplotlib. The code is modular, well-commented, and demonstrates geometry and 3D modeling skills.
